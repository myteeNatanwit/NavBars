Navigate Bars
=============

This template is used in various project. 
The icons from http://dryicons.com/free-icons png format in different sets of size.
I use http://css.spritegen.com to make the sprites and css.
Beleive there is better way, but I do this way bc it is fast n convenient for me.

#Features
Only Css.
1- transparent background: Bc the application is ontop of a video or image background, so it need to b tranparent. U can change it in the bars.css with opacity.

2- Sprite icon locates on top of text for the li.

3- There r 2 bars at the footer, float left and right.

Just have a play with the source code, having fun with the numbers, change them, make them big number, or small one to see the effect. That how I did.

#Usage

1-use Bars.css for the stylesheet. The white16 is for the bottom bars. White24 for the mid bar and Black18 for the top bar.
Actually the sprites of Black18 is not black. I manually painted them with PS changing from black to gray so that they are visible in both light and dard background.

2-Depending to you need, can use any of the bars or all of them.

3-Changing the icons by replaceing the Css and its icons. Note that you got make the right size of the wrapping class. ie. icon18 is for 18px sprites.

#Setup
There is no Javascript, no Jquery in this template. Only Css3. Obviously it does nothing yet. 

#Bugs?
none, as far as I known, but there is room for improvement ..ie icons dont look good but they are templates only anyway.
