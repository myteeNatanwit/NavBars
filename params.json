U can change it in the bars.css with opacity.\r\n\r\n2- Sprite icon locates on top of text for the li.\r\n\r\n3- There r 2 bars at the footer, float left and right.\r\n\r\nJust have a play with the source code, having fun with the numbers, change them, make them big number, or small one to see the effect. That how I did.\r\n\r\n#Usage\r\n\r\n1-use Bars.css for the stylesheet. The white16 is for the bottom bars. White24 for the mid bar and Black18 for the top bar.\r\nActually the sprites of Black18 is not black. I manually painted them with PS changing from black to gray so that they are visible in both light and dard background.\r\n\r\n2-Depending to you need, can use any of the bars or all of them.\r\n\r\n3-Changing the icons by replaceing the Css and its icons. Note that you got make the right size of the wrapping class. ie. icon18 is for 18px sprites.\r\n\r\n#Setup\r\nThere is no Javascript, no Jquery in this template. Only Css3. Obviously it does nothing yet. \r\n\r\n#Bugs?\r\nnone, as far as I known, but there is room for improvement ..ie icons dont look good but they are templates only anyway.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
